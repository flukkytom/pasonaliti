  <p>What is DISC?</p>
  <p>DISC is often described as a &quot;Personality Test&quot;. In reality, DISC is really more like a &quot;personality profiling system&quot; which is why we call our profiles the DISC Personality Profile.</p>
  <p>A DISC Profile utilizes a method for understanding behavior, temperament, and personality. A DISC Profile provides a comprehensive overview of the way that people think, act, and interact. It is the most widely used profiling tool of its kind, and is supported by decades of validation and reliability studies.</p>
  <p>The DISC assessment is a tool to measure four primary behavioral traits:</p>
  <p>Dominance (D)<br />
    Influence (I)<br />
    Steadiness (S)<br />
    Conscientiousness (C)</p>
